# Minecraft

This is a simple recreation of the popular game 'Minecraft'. No rights are reserved,
and this piece of software is purely made for learning purposes and without any
intentions to distribute/sell as to avoid copyright infringements.

## Modules
All of the following modules are custom made and together work as the building blocks
for the game engine:
* `camera.hpp` - create an FPS camera class
* `fileIO.hpp` - read files, intended (__not yet__) cross-platform functionality
* `shaders.hpp` - load and compile shaders together
* `texture.hpp` - wrapper class for all game textures
* `timer.hpp` - simple timer loop
* `window.hpp` - draw the main window
